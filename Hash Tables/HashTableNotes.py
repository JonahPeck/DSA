#Hash Tables - dictionaries are made up of a key value pair
#hash tables work through a hash function works by performing a hash on a key and run it through a function and it returns an address for the key value pair
#this is how a dictionary is stored
#Hashes are one way - you can only insert into a hash and recieve an address not vice versa
#Hashes are deterministic - every time a key is put in you will expect to get the same output

#collisions - happens when a key value pair is put in a place where another key value pair already exists
#separate chaining - putting 
#linear probing - form of open addressing
